# chartpy
Easy graphs for Python Flask using Chart.js

The only file you need to is chartpy.py. This file sets up all of the things necessary to create the json format that chart.js uses to make the actual chart. 
I find this much more convient than using the javascript.

An example of how to do it is attached with the app.

To run it all you need to do is install and run 
"flask run"

FUTRUE PLANS
I plan on adding more chart options other than the scatter plot. Feel free to add your own favorite charts.

Check out https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js and support that project!
